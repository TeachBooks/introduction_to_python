# Installation

In this course you will be learning the programming language
Python. To try it in practice and to do the course exercises you need
a way to run Python programs on your own computer.

If you use Windows or a Mac, we recommend installing Anaconda
following the instructions below.

```{admonition} Attention
:class: danger
Do not install Anaconda in a location (path) that contains
non-latin characters, for example if you have Chinese or other
non-latin characters in your Windows user name.  Select an
installation path which does not contain such characters. Also it's
best to avoid spaces in the path.

# First Exercise Notebook

* Go to the next page, which will open the first notebook exercise, which you should download to your computer, and then need to open with Jupyter Notebook following the steps below.
* In the "Documents" folder in your laptop, create a new folder named "GrandChallenges". Under this new folder create a folder named "Exercises". Now download the exercise, find where it was downloaded to and then move the exercise to the folder named "Exercises".
* Unzip the zip file. For a Mac: just double click on it. For windows: click one time on the zip file, right-click the zip file, choose Extract All, click Extract.
* Jupyter Notebook should be automatically installed with Anaconda. You can launch it from the Anaconda Navigator app, or search for anaconda prompt in your searchbar, write the following command: "jupyter notebook", and press enter to run it.
* Once Jupyter notebook has been opened in your browser, you can search for the Jupyter Notebook "Exercise Notebook 1" in the folder where you downloaded it to and open it.
