# Installation

In this course you will be learning the programming language
Python. To try it in practice and to do the course exercises you need
a way to run Python programs on your own computer.

If you use Linux (which we highly recommended in the long term), you
can install Jupyter with your system's package manager. You can ask a
TA or the lecturer for help.

If you have Windows or a Mac, we recommend installing Anaconda,
following the instructions below.

## Installing Anaconda on Windows

* Go to [anaconda.com/download](anaconda.com/download)
* Click "skip registration"
* In the box "Windows", download "64-Bit Graphical Installer"
* Figure out where you downloaded the file. Run it.
  Complete the installation according to the instructions you see.


## Installing Anaconda on a Mac

* Go to [anaconda.com/download](anaconda.com/download)
* In the box "Mac", choose one of the options.
  Choose "Apple Silicon" if your Mac is new and has an m1, m2, or m3 processor.
  Choose "Intel Chip" if your Mac is older and has an Intel processor.
  In any case, choose a "Graphical Installer"
* Figure out where you downloaded the file. Run it.
  Complete the installation according to the instructions you see.

```{admonition} Attention
:class: danger
Do not install Anaconda in a location (path) that contains
non-latin characters, for example if you have Chinese or other
non-latin characters in your Windows user name.  Select an
installation path which does not contain such characters. Also it's
best to avoid spaces in the path.
