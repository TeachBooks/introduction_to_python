# Welcome to Introduction to Python

This Introduction to Python course is part of Exploring the Grand Challenges (ECTB1110A) for first-year BSc Earth, Climate & Technology students at TU Delft. The accompanying book contains the theoretical material, while exercises are provided as separate notebooks on Brightspace, which must be completed and submitted in pairs.

In this course, you will use **Python Notebooks** with Jupyter Notebooks or Jupyter Lab for exercises. These notebooks allow you to run scripts in segments, called cells, enabling you to execute specific code parts individually. To run a cell, select it and press **'run cell'** or use the **Shift + Enter** shortcut. This is particularly useful for data analysis, as it allows for quick modifications or the addition of explanations, formulas, or visualizations.

## Book Layout

Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between sections. Embedded links provide a consistent narrative across related topics, helping you explore connections between different content areas.

Pages with interactive coding feature a **rocket icon** (<i class="fa fa-rocket" aria-hidden="true"></i>) at the top right. Hover over it and click on <span style="white-space: nowrap;">{guilabel}`Live Code`</span>. Wait for the necessary packages to load, and the interactive content will then be ready to use.

<!-- For Lesson 1, the topics are to set up Python on your computer (Installation)
and to study Files and Folders, part 1 to 5.
For this course, and all other courses too, we recommend that you create a folder for the course to store course file and exercise notebooks that you hand in.
