# Welcome to Introduction to Python

This Python course forms part of the course AESB1000 Grand Challenges.
This book contains the study material for the course, which you
will work on during the classes. For every class, there is a separate
exercise "notebook" on BrightSpace, which you need to complete and
submit (in pairs).

As additional study material, we recommend the open source book
["Think Python 2nd Edition"](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)
by Allen B. Downey.

For Lesson 1, the topics are to set up Python on your computer (Installation)
and to study Files and Folders, part 1 to 5.
For this course, and all other courses too, we recommend that you create a folder for the course to store course file and exercise notebooks that you hand in.
