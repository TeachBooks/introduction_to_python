    "There are also other data types in Python, which were not mentioned in this part (in case they are not as useful or will be introduced later). For instance, <b>Complex</b> is one of them. The sad truth is that every software developer searches the web a lot. It's not because she/he is lazy or incompetent. It is because programming languages are constantly updated and some tools are limited to a narrow field of applications. It is impractical to learn everything at once, therefore every coder has learned how to look up the functionality their task requires. Therefore, it is crucial for you to learn how to search as well. Complex type is used in Python to represent complex numbers. If you haven't heard about them — a complex number is a number, which has a real and an imaginary part. For example, $x = 17 + 5i$. Here, $x$ is a complex number with a real part of $17$ and an imaginary part of $5$.<br><br> Your task is to create a variable <code>my_complex_num</code> of Complex type and assign a $3 + 2i$ value to it. For that you will have to Google a bit. Try to look for something like \"Python complex variables\". Python is very popular and you will be able to find everything you need. Make sure to filter the information you need — not everything you will find will be useful for this simple exercise.\n",
