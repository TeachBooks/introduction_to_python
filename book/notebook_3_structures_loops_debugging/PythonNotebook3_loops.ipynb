Previous Sections introduced a lot of fundamental concepts, but they still don't unveil the true power of any programming language — loops!<br><br>If we want to perform the same procedure multiple times, then we would have to take the same code and copy-paste it. This approach would work, however it would require a lot of manual work and it does not look cool.<br><br>This problem is resolved with a <i>loop</i> construction.
